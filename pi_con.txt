My name is Bonnie King and I'm a Linux sysadmin.  

I'm going to talk about doing IO stuff in Python on the Raspberry Pi.

This is obviously going to be really short, basically I'll go over the hello world
of pi GPIO.

****** 1 ******

So the Raspberry Pi is a single board computer 
with an ARM-based SOC (system on a chip) 
which includes a pretty hefty GPU, can do HDMI out, 
has ethernet built in, and USB.

The people behind the Raspberry Pi Foundation i
(a UK-based non profit) wanted to build a cheap, 
accessible 
computer for kids to learn programming on, something like the 
BBC Micro/Timex Sinclair which so i
many people learned on back in the 80s and 90s.

****** 2 ******

People are using it as a media center (screenshot)

****** 3 ******
For parallel processing... (jpeg)

****** 4 ******
And of course in education which is the Foundations mandate (kids)

****** 5 ******
But they are also doing lots of reall awesome electronics projects.
It also, and this is maybe the most exciting thing, at least to me, provides some low-level IO

exposed on this header

****** 6 ******
These pins are configurable to do different things including  all the most common 
serial interfaces (UART, SPI, I2C).  
They tend to be missing from modern PCs (we are pretty much stuck with USB usually).
Some of them also can be used for general purpose
input-output.

Which means you can detect a high or low voltage (input)
Or emit a voltage for output.

This lends the Pi really well to electronics projects.  

There are several microcontroller boards such as Arduino 
that allow you to do physical computing and 

****** 7 ******
You can't really compare them 
and for minimalists the Pi is very much overkill (slide)
for anything you could use an Arduino for.  But I like it because:

****** 8 ******
- I already know linux and it can do things like run a web server, ssh, play media, etc
- I can program it in my favourite language, Python, and my favourite sorta-language, bash...  
- It has ethernet built-in
- Probably the one thing something like an arduino has that the Pi doesnt
Is an Analog to Digital Converter or ADC, which limits what you can do with sensors,
but you can get external components for that stuff.

****** 9 ******
So let me talk about the Python GPIO library and how to make stuff happen.

Ben croston wrote a module Rpi.GPIO.  It actually only supports using the GPIO pins as inputs and outputs and 
doesn't yet supprot SPI, I2C or PWM but seems to be under active development.  

****** 10 ******
There is also a startup called Quick2Wire that has released a GPIO API for the Pi, they are working on producing expansion boards and stuff..  
It's called quick2wire-python-api that does include serial interface support.  It's also Python 3 only.

For simple input and output, RPi.GPIO and quick2wire are pretty much equivalent in how they are used, so I'll talk about RPi.GPIO.

****** 12 ******
this is what you do:

Basically after importing the module (slide)

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

****** 13 *******
You need to set up a pin.  
There are two numbering schemes for the GPIO pins, "BCM" and "BOARD", 
BCM stand for broadcom
referring to the pin numbers on the actual broadcom SOC and on the headers.

Most people seem to use the BCM numbering

So we set the mode to which numbering scheme we are going to use (slide)

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

***** 14 *****
So then we do some setup on a pin:
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.OUT)

This is going to set pin 17 on the board as an output.

***** 15 *******
To turn this pin "on": (slide)
GPIO.output(17, GPIO.HIGH)

****** 16 ******
We can also set up the pin as an input.  (slide)
GPIO.setup(4, GPIO.IN)

Then if we do (slide)
******* 17 *******
input_value = GPIO.input(4)

We can read a value, which corresponds to voltage detected on the pin.
When the pin is high GPIO.input(4) will return True.

***** 18 *****
This Pi right here is flashing a blinky whenever it gets a click on this Geiger counter, which is a kit I bought from MightyOhm.

And this is the loop that's running on it...

****** 19 *****
Here is an example of a halloween thing I helped write.

This has a web interface that I used bottle for.  But people are doing craxy things with web sockets.

If you want to know more about making cool projects on the pi
I recommend the adafruit tutorials.  

on raspberry pi.org you can download the distro images, theres a blog and forum and stuff

THank you!
