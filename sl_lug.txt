Scientific Linux

- community rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, affectionately known
as TUV (The Upstream Vendor)
- NOT AFFILIATED, SANCTIONED OR SUPPORTED BY UPSTREAM
- packaged by a dedicated team at Fermilab
- active user community

Who?

- Project founded at Fermilab
- everything hosted at fermilab

Why?

- reduce duplicated effort at research sites, and provide
common install base.
- Red Hat Linux, CERN and Fermi both did their own versions
- security issues (sendmail was on, no firewall), mostly changed installer
- concept of workgroups (custom code in installer [written in C in Red Hat 5]), which turned into Sites
- in 2003, Red Hat Linux went away
- HEPiX October 2003, Connie proposed rebuilding srpms
- easy for organizations to adopt
- CERN mentioned that they could collaborate
- HEPL was never really released, only ever released as SL (March 2003, HEPiX in May).

- unify the Scientific Community on one OS.

Why Red Hat?
Debian, SuSE, Caldera, TurboLinux, Slackware
Original Fermi Linux requirements:
- needed a batch installer (kickstart
- package manager that handled dependencies
- ability to buy support if needed
- needed the source (SuSE didn't originally release everything)
- easy to install (physicists doing their own desktop installs etc)

Scientific Linux requirements
- Fermi (Connie and Troy) (and CERN) were familiar with the Red Hat way
- source rpms available

1996-1997
- PC Farms pilot project to start using commodity PCs instead of SGIs etc
- needed an OS
- Looked at Linux, BSD (Linux had more traction)
- pilot project running ~32 PCs (free Red Hat)
- CHEP paper, 96 CHEP by "GP", the idea of using PCs for farm nodes
- made Fermi Linux after encountering the security "issues"

Connie was the group leader of the desktop support group (SGIs)
Lisa was the leader of the farm group (SGI, IBM)

1998
CHEP was in Chicago, Connie announced Fermi Linux 5, based on Red Hat 5

Troy packaged OpenAFS and Connie put it in the release.

DESY was running SuSE and switched to Scientific Linux once released

Used by?

Major research projects around the globe use Scientific Linux.


Name?

- called Scientific Linux because of the goals and user base of the project.
- Scientific Linux is the "public" version of Scientific Linux Fermi AKA FermiLinux which is specifically configured
for the lab (there is also Scientific Linux Cern, and soon to be Scientific Linux Kisti).

History:

- first release (who, why, when)
- Fermilinux 5: august 1998
- LTS 3, late 2003/early 2004, SL3 may 10 2004 based on RHEL


Where it is used at the lab:

- HPC
- GRID
- lattice QCD
- CMS
- other experiments
- Theory
- Scientific Workstations


- Fermilab Run II (D0 and CDF)
- Lattice QCD
Fermilab operates large clusters of computers for LQCD as part of the national computational
infrastructure for Lattice QCD established by the Department of Energy. Fermilab has
successfully deployed 5 Lattice QCD production clusters totaling 2,500 nodes, each running
Scientific Linux and reliably delivered over 55 sustained LQCD TFlop-years (over 250 Linpack
TFlop-years) worth of computing since 2006. Scientific Linux kernels enabled the provisioning
and managing of a highly scalable 0.5 Petabyte Lustre file-system delivering a peak aggregate
bandwidth of 2GB/s required for large parallel jobs on the order of 1024 processes each.

- CMS (Large Hadron Collider at CERN)
Scientific Linux is an important component of the CMS Tier 1 facility at Fermilab. This
distribution has been optimized for use for High Energy Physics (HEP), and is in use at our
sister lab at CERN, giving collaborators all over the world a uniform interface to CMS
applications. It is deployed at Fermilab on both interactive nodes and more than a thousand
batch compute nodes. Critical services are deployed using Scientific Linux, including
distributed storage systems, grid interfaces, data transfer agents, and workflow management
systems.

"Intensity Frontier"

eg, MINOS
Main Injector Oscillation Search (MINOS)
The Minos experiment uses Scientific Linux for virtually all of its online and offline computing.
This includes 32 systems in the data acquisition systems, control room computers, and all
offline computing resources. Offline computing includes Interactive login systems, a local Batch
system, MySQL and PostgreSQL database servers, Web application servers, Fermigrid
systems, and all data storage servers.

Different from CentOS?

- not really very different from centos
- support for yum-security plugin
- updateinfo.xml

demo?

Provides for easy CVE search
• Provided by yum-plugin-security rpm
• Requires updateinfo.xml in repodata/ which we will add

yum info-sec --cve CVE-2011-2372
Loaded plugins: refresh-packagekit, security
thunderbird-3.1.15-1.el6
Update ID : SLSA-2011:1342-01
Release : Scientific Linux 6
Type : security
Status : stable
CVEs : CVE-2011-2372
Files : thunderbird-3.1.15-1.el6_1.x86_64.rpm

How?

- staying inline with upstream requires a lot of time and infrastructure.
- TUV publishes source RPMs for all packages.  Then we must
build them using two tools:

- mock (SL5)

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock

"Mock creates chroots and builds packages in them. 
Its only task is to reliably populate a chroot and 
attempt to build a package in that chroot."

- creates a chrooted area, populate /proc, /sys...
- uses a predefined list of rpms to install (which is actually a "metadata" rpm with
just "requires"), buildsys-build
- has a yum repo defined, where we will get rpms to fulfill dependencies

- mock/koji (SL6)

"Koji is the software that builds RPM packages for the 
Fedora project. It uses Mock to create chroot environments 
to perform builds."

screen shot of SL koji?

or look at
http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/

Revisor:
- customize and compose an installation and live media
- create "re-spins"


Security:

Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA)

- published on a best effort basis (within a couple of days of the RH alert)
no guarantees...
- bugfixes (RHBAs) are published every tuesday, in contrast to CentOS who
publishes them in real time.

Finally...

Is Scientific Linux right for you?

- Do you want support, an SLA, etc etc?

Then use RHEL!
